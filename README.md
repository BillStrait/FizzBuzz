# FizzBuzz
BBY Sample Application
This is a sample application. The requirements were to receive an array of arbitrary objects and create output if the object was 
1) an intiger 
2) divisible by 3
3) divisible by 5
4) divisible by 3 and 5.

All business logic is in the index method of homecontroller.cs

I was not able to divise a way for asp.net to accept an array of arbitrary objects. In a real world scenario I would consult a colleague or look for an application that does similar for guidance.
